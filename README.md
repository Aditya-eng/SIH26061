## The idea in one paragraph

A polar research station receives **one fuel delivery a year**. Its renewables are unpredictable
and physically fragile, its largest loads are thermal and peak exactly when generation is worst,
and **its own diesel exhaust contaminates the atmospheric measurements the station exists to
collect**. So the objective is not minimum cost per kWh — every commercial microgrid EMS already
does that — it is *maximise the probability of serving critical load until the ship returns*,
subject to not poisoning your own science. That reframing is the project.

Forecasting, MILP dispatch, battery scheduling and critical-load prioritisation are all built
here, because the system needs them. They are **table stakes**, not the innovation: ABB,
Schneider, Siemens, SMA and HOMER ship that feature list today.

## Two codebases, and the difference between them matters

| | [`engine/`](engine/) | [`web/`](web/) |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | The real pipeline: physics digital twin, quantile forecasts, MILP/MPC dispatch under a Monte Carlo seasonal fuel allocation | "Pink Monster" — a dependency-free browser demo of the same workflow, for the internal round |
| Weather | **Real ERA5 reanalysis**, hourly, 9 years, at Maitri's coordinates (−70.7667, 11.7333) | **Seeded synthetic** weather and synthetic forecast ranges |
| Optimiser | MILP over a 36 h rolling horizon (PuLP + HiGHS) | Beam search, width 14, 36 h horizon |
| Numbers below | Measured from a full 210-day season | Illustrative — the demo does not claim validated performance |
| Runs | `python run.py` | opens in a browser, offline |

**Read that row about weather twice before quoting any number.** The demo's figures are
illustrative; the engine's are measured against real reanalysis on a documented twin. Do not mix
them in a pitch.

## Results — engine, 210-day season (2023-02-01 → 2023-08-30)

Identical weather, identical station, identical physical resolver for every controller. Tank
72,000 L, deliberately sized so the season is marginal (see `engine/calibrate.py`).

| Controller | Fuel (L) | vs B | Critical outages | Renewable used | Clean-air compliance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A — fixed schedule | 72,000 (**dry**) | — | 36 events / 9,266 kWh | 69.1% | 40.5% |
| B — tuned rule-based | 72,000 (**dry**) | 0% | 6 events / 328 kWh | 84.8% | 27.4% |
| **C — proposed** | **63,385** | **−12.0%** | **0 events / 0 kWh** | 92.5% | 43.7% |
| C-point — ablation | 63,280 | −12.1% | 1 event / 8 kWh | 92.7% | 43.3% |
| D — perfect-foresight oracle | 62,485 | −13.2% | 0 events / 0 kWh | 93.5% | 49.0% |

C closes **91%** of the gap between the tuned baseline and the perfect-foresight bound. Both
baselines empty the tank before the season ends; C finishes above the emergency reserve.

Stress tests (C against baseline B, same season):

| Scenario | B unserved critical | C unserved critical |
|---|---|---|
| Four-day blizzard | 809.1 kWh / 8 events | **0.0 kWh / 0 events** |
| Primary genset down 48 h in deep winter | 325.8 kWh / 3 events | 97.9 kWh / 1 event |
| 12 h badly wrong forecast, truth unchanged | — | 0.0 kWh, fuel within 12 L of nominal |

Forecast skill on the unseen test year: load MAE 1.82 kW (2.2% MAPE), PV 3.01 kW (12.1%), wind
6.53 kW (20.0%), with p90 coverage 89–93%. **Calibration, not MAE, is the number that matters** —
the optimiser sizes its reserve from the predicted spread.

## What makes this polar rather than generic

1. **Resupply-horizon fuel budgeting** (`engine/src/polarems/fuelbudget.py`) — a Monte Carlo
   allocator over 8 historical weather years sets a daily litre allowance holding
   `P(critical load served to the ship) ≥ 99%`; the MILP prices every litre beyond it, with
   carry-over between horizons. No commercial EMS optimises against a single annual resupply.
2. **Science-integrity-constrained dispatch** (`engine/src/polarems/cleanair.py`) — when
   *forecast* wind would carry exhaust into the clean-air sampling sector, generator hours are
   priced and the battery carries the window. Modelled by no EMS product.
3. **Physical-availability forecasting** (`engine/src/polarems/availability.py`) — snow cover and
   blade icing are state variables that decorrelate from the weather forecast: the forecast can
   say clear sky while the array is under drift.

## Running it

```bash
# demo — needs only Node >= 20, no install, no network
cd web && npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm test && npm run build

# engine — Python 3.12+
cd engine
python -m venv .venv && .venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt   # Linux/macOS: .venv/bin/pip
.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests -q                                 # 14 tests, ~2 s
.venv/Scripts/python run.py --days 30 --no-scenarios --controllers A,B,C  # ~4 min sanity run
.venv/Scripts/python run.py --days 210                                  # full season, ~45-60 min
```

The ERA5 Parquet cache is committed, so both the tests and the pipeline run **with the network
down** — which is the station's actual operating condition, and part of the pitch.

Outputs land in `engine/results/run.json`, `engine/results/metrics.csv` and
`engine/dashboard/dashboard.html` (a single self-contained file — Plotly is inlined, so it opens
by double-click and works offline).

## Continuous integration

- **`ci.yml`** — runs the engine's unit tests plus a deliberately short **14-day** smoke run
  (three controllers, no scenarios) to prove the pipeline is wired end to end, and runs the
  demo's tests and asset checks. It does **not** run the 210-day season: that is ~45–60 minutes
  of real MILP solves and belongs on a workstation, not on a CI runner. Reproduce it locally.
- **`deploy-demo.yml`** — publishes `web/dist` to GitHub Pages on every push that touches `web/`.
  Requires **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** to be enabled once.

## Honest limitations

- **No public electrical-load data exists for any polar research station.** The load is
  synthetic, built bottom-up from headcount and outdoor temperature, and every parameter carries
  its source and a sensitivity range in `engine/config/station.json`, surfaced in the dashboard's
  Assumptions tab.
- **The same team wrote the simulator and the controller.** Mitigations: a genuinely tuned
  baseline B (zero critical outages over a full year with an unconstrained tank), a
  perfect-foresight oracle bound, and a published ablation.
- **Maitri II ratings are not public**, so the deliverable is framed as a sizing and
  operating-policy explorer for a station still on the drawing board.
- **No hardware in the loop.** `engine/emit_setpoints.py` emits Modbus registers and MQTT
  messages, but nothing has been tested against a real genset controller.
